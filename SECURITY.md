## Scope

Security-sensitive areas include direct application execution, the optional Docker isolation
baseline, Git revision and disposable-worktree handling, evidence privacy and integrity, path
containment, and process/container cleanup. Review
[docs/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md](docs/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md) before running untrusted code.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not disclose exploit details, secrets, or sensitive evidence in a public GitHub issue.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting for this repository: open the repository's
**Security** tab, select **Advisories**, and choose **Report a vulnerability**. Reports submitted
through that flow remain private to repository maintainers and invited security collaborators.

No response or remediation SLA is promised.
